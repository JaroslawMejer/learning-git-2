			<h2>Inside the fire</h2>
				<p>Ooh, Devin!
					Won't go to heaven.
					She's just another lost soul about to be mine again,
					Leave her!
					we will receive her.
					It is beyond your control, will you ever meet again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Devin!
					One of eleven!
					Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
					She was taken!
					And then forsaken.
					You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Devin
					Lies
					Beyond
					This
					Portal,
					Take
					The
					Word
					Of
					Two
					Immortals...!
